# EmotionRecognition
This program uses the DeepFake database to analyze and predict the emotions of people on a webcam. The goal of this program is to utilize it on American Airline passenger planes to detect when passengers are in distress and not enjoying their experience, whether that be from poor service or from their surroundings. This technology can be utilized to make adjustments as necessary, resulting in an all-around better customer experience.
